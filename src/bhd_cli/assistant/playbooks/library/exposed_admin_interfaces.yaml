  Validation playbook for verifying exposure of administrative interfaces
  (SSH, RDP, VNC, Telnet, etc.) to unauthorized networks. This playbook
  focuses on safe verification and documentation.

prerequisites:
  - Written authorization for network scanning
  - Documented scope of authorized target IP ranges
  - Understanding of expected network topology

steps:
  - step_number: 1
    action: Confirm Target Scope
    description: |
      Verify that all target IP addresses are within authorized scope.
      Document the approved IP ranges and ensure scanning will not
      impact out-of-scope systems.
    expected_outcome: Verified list of in-scope IP addresses/ranges
    tools:
      - Scope documentation

  - step_number: 2
    action: Identify Open Administrative Ports
    description: |
      Scan for common administrative service ports: SSH (22), Telnet (23),
      RDP (3389), VNC (5900), etc. Record open ports and basic service banners.
    expected_outcome: List of open administrative ports per host
    tools:
      - nmap (basic scan)
      - netstat (from authorized host)

  - step_number: 3
    action: Determine Network Exposure
    description: |
      Determine if administrative services are accessible from unauthorized
      networks. Check if services are Internet-facing, internal-only, or
      properly segmented.
    expected_outcome: Network exposure classification for each service
    tools:
      - nmap
      - traceroute
      - Network diagrams

  - step_number: 4
    action: Banner Grabbing (Passive)
    description: |
      Collect service banners to identify software versions. DO NOT attempt
      authentication. Record exact banner text and version information.
    expected_outcome: Service version information for vulnerability assessment
    tools:
      - nmap (-sV)
      - netcat (nc)
      - telnet (for banner only)

  - step_number: 5
    action: Check for Default Credentials Documentation
    description: |
      Research if identified services/versions have known default credentials.
      DO NOT attempt to authenticate. Document findings for recommendation purposes.
    expected_outcome: List of services with potential default credential risks
    tools:
      - Vendor documentation
      - CVE databases

  - step_number: 6
    action: Document Access Control Measures
    description: |
      Identify any visible access controls: firewall rules, VPN requirements,
      IP whitelisting, fail2ban, etc. Record what controls are apparent.
    expected_outcome: Documentation of observed security controls
    tools:
      - Network documentation
      - Repeated connection attempts (observational only)

  title: Exposed Administrative Interface - Inadequate Network Segmentation
  description: |
    Administrative services (SSH, RDP, VNC, Telnet, etc.) are accessible from
    untrusted networks. These services provide privileged access and should be
    restricted to authorized management networks only.
  impact_level: High
  likelihood: High
  remediation: |
    Implement network-layer access controls for administrative services:
    1. Remove administrative services from Internet-facing networks
    2. Require VPN or jump host access for remote administration
    3. Implement firewall rules restricting admin services to management VLANs
    4. Use network segmentation to isolate administrative interfaces
    5. Enable multi-factor authentication for all remote administrative access
    6. Implement IP whitelisting for known administrative source IPs
    7. Monitor and log all administrative service access attempts
    8. Consider replacing insecure protocols (Telnet) with encrypted alternatives (SSH)
  business_impact: |
    Exposed administrative interfaces are primary targets for attackers. Compromise
    can lead to complete system takeover, data breaches, ransomware deployment,
    and persistent network access. Brute force and credential stuffing attacks
    against these services are common and often successful.

safety_constraints:
  - DO NOT attempt authentication or login to any service
  - DO NOT perform brute force or password guessing attacks
  - DO NOT exploit any identified vulnerabilities
  - DO NOT perform aggressive scans that could cause service disruption
  - DO NOT scan outside authorized IP ranges
  - STOP scanning if any system becomes unstable
  - DO NOT use default credentials even if known
  - Coordinate scanning activities with system owners to avoid conflicts
